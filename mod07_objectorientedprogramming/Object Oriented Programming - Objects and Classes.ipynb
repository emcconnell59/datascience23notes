    "Python is an object-oriented programming language, but Python doesn't force you to use classes, inheritance, and methods.\n",

    "Every value in Python is an object. Objects are a way to combine data and the functions that handle that data. This combination is called *encapsulation*. The data items and functions are objects are called *attributes*, and in particular, the function attributes are called *methods*. For example, the operator `+` on integers calls a method of integers, and the operator `+` on strings calls a method of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions, modules, methods, classes, etc., are all first class objects. This means that these objects can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stored in a container\n",
    "- Passed to a function as a parameter\n",
    "- Returned by a function\n",
    "- Bound to a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "One can access an attribute of an object using the *dot operator*: `object.attribute`. For example, if `L` is a list, we can refer to the method `append` with `L.append`. This method call can look, for instance, like this: `L.append(4)`. Because modules are also objects in Python, we can interpret the expression `math.pi` as accessing the data attribute `pi` of the module object `math`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers like 2 and 100 are instances of type `int`. Similarly, `\"hello\"` is an instance of type `str`. When we write `s=set()`, we are actually creating a new instance of type `set`, and binding the resulting instance object to `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A user can define their own data types. These are called *classes*. A user can call these classes like they were functions, and they return a new instance object of that type. Classes can be thought of as recipes for creating objects.\n",

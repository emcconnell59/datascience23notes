    "Python is a flexible language, and there are several ways to use it depending on your particular task. One thing that distinguishes Python from other programming languages is that it is *interpreted* rather than *compiled*. This means that it is executed line by line, which allows programming to be interactive in a way that is not directly possible with compiled languages like Fortran, C, or Java. This section will describe four primary ways you can run Python code: the *Python interpreter*, the *IPython interpreter*, via *self-contained scripts*, or in the *Jupyter Notebook*."
